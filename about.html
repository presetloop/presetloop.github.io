      <p class="text-justify">Origin: It seems like so long ago now as indeed it was. All we had was a Spanish guitar, a synthesizer and a 4 track recorder. Recording daily for weeks and months, through years and decades, establishing a substantial <span class="text-[#FD6A6D]"><a href="/api/">catalogue</a></span> of musical demos, funky jams and full album releases. Eventually the studio grew to house live drums, microphones, guitars and basses, more synths and a choice selection of percussion. Everything we needed to bring an infinite amount of self expression into being via musical composition and performance.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Impact: In 2022 we launched our first series of sample packs. Drum hits, percussive elements and synth sounds, freely available for you to compose and remix your own tracks. Centered around an innovative 'Guest Pass' <span class="text-[#FD6A6D]"><a href="https://samplepacks.presetloops.com/login" target="_blank">login</a></span> system, we built an entire platform dedicated to auditioning and downloading custom sounds. An ever changing repository of colours and textures, providing the foundation for inspired sound design.</p>
      <div class="mt-4">Philosophy: Follow every musical idea to its natural conclusion, with the <span class="text-[#F33333]"><a href="/api/charts/">record</a></span> button pressed.</div>
